🎯 Project Overview In the money driven world we live in today, an interesting question is what makes different nations' wealth increase? 💰 In this project, I explored the Wealth of Nations dataset, transforming raw data into compelling insights with clean visuals and interactive storytelling. Using Microsoft Excel for data wrangling and Tableau for dynamic visualisations, I built an intuitive dashboard that makes economic data both informative and engaging even for someone with no background on finance or datasets. 🛠️ Tools & Skills: Excel: !!Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, corrected inconsistencies, and organized the dataset for analysis. !!Data Manipulation: Leveraged formulas, pivot tables, and logical functions to extract key metrics. Tableau: !!Visualisations: Created impactful visuals—bar charts 📊, line graphs 📈, and geographic maps 🗺️—to highlight economic trends. !!Dashboard Design: Integrated visuals into an interactive, user-friendly dashboard that tells a clear, data-driven story. 🌟 What You’ll Discover 🧭 Economic Trends: Explore global GDP growth over time. 🌎 Regional Insights: Compare wealth and population data across continents. 🔍 Key Indicators: Identify the major drivers of national wealth. 🚀 How to Explore 🖱️ View the Tableau Dashboard 📂 Dive into the Excel file and raw dataset in this repo to see the data behind the visuals. 🎉 Let’s Dive In!
